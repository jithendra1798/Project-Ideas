# Project Ideas

## 1. Create a Chatroom Using Cloud Services
> ### **Project premise**
* Messaging apps are some of those under the radar applications which impact our daily lives so much that we don’t even notice them anymore. One major skill that this project addresses is the ability to dynamically update the view when the database updates without having to refresh the page.

* From the development viewpoint, this can be tricky if you’re not used to it — or if you don’t know which services to use. AWS has a thing called AppSync, with Google you can use Firebase, and Azure has SignalR. These are just suggestions, and there are other potential architectures you can use for the different services.

* This project will extend your knowledge on the products that are provided by your chosen Cloud provider. Cloud computing is essentially a product. Learning to use these products is what extends your technical boundaries as a developer.

> ### **Business rules requirements**
